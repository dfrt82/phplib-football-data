# phplib-football-data
Small library that implements some basic functionalities of football-data.org's API v2.

See the code in index.php on how to use the library, which should only serve you as a starting point. 

In case you have docker setup on your system, you can make use of it by just executing

````
docker-compose up -d
````

and then opening up localhost:9988 in your browser to see something like shown below.

Best,
daniel
